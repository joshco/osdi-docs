# Errors

OSDI reports response codes and errors according to a standard schema.  A combination of HTTP response codes and error objects is used to communicate the success or failure of a request.

The link relation label for an Error resource is ```osdi:error``` for a single Error resource.

## Background

### Atomic vs Non-Atomic Requests

While most OSDI requests are atomic (i.e., the request either succeeds completely, possibly changing the state of the system, or fails completely, leaving system unchanged), it is possible to create non-atomic requests using helpers.

For example, the [Person Signup Helper](person_signup.html) allows consumers to create a [Person](people.html) and a [Tagging](taggings.html) for the person in a single request.  However, if the Person  resource is valid but the Tagging is not, the Person may be created but the Tagging may not be created.

The ````osdi:error```` object for both types of requests is identical, except that atomic requests include only a single ````resource_status```` object, and non-atomic requests include multiple ````resource_status```` objects.  For non-atomic requests, if some resource(s) were created or updated as part of the request, the server may add these resources to the response, alongside the ````osdi:error```` resource.

_[Back to top...](#)_

### Batch Requests

Batch requests are a collection of similar requests sent to the server in one OSDI call.  For example, the ````osdi:people_import_helper```` request includes an array of signups, where each array item is what would normally be in a single request to ````osdi:person_signup_helper````.

The top level Batch Request is known as the parent request, while the array items are called sub-requests.

In order to report errors for each sub-request, the ````batch_errors```` attribute is included, which is an array of ````osdi:error```` objects defined here.

### Response Codes for Atomic Requests

The following response codes correspond to success or failure of different kinds of atomic requests.  Response codes may be provided in the body of the response using the ````response_code```` field, unless forbidden by the HTTP spec (e.g., if the response code is 204).

| Type of request | Example | Description of result | Response Response Code | Response Body
|---------------- |-------- |---------------------- |--------- |----
| Any             | n/a     | Unexpected server error | 500 | [ErrorDescription](#error-description) indicating unexpected error; reference_code is recommended
| Any             | n/a     | Request not supported | 500 | [ErrorDescription](#error-description) indicating not-implemented

## Error Fields

A list of fields specific to the Error resource.

|Name          |Type      |Description
|-----------    |-----------|--------------
|request_type   |enum       | One of "atomic", "non-atomic"
|response_code  |int        | An indication of the success or failure of the request as a whole.  Atomic requests should provide the appropriate value from the [Response Codes for Atomic Requests](#response-codes-for-atomic-requests) table.  Non-atomic requests should provide a value of 400 if the request is deemed unsuccessful, or 207 if it is deemed successful, but with non-critical errors.
|resource_status |[ResourceStatus[]](#resource-status) | An indication of the success or failure of each individual request.

### Related Objects

#### Resource Status

|Name          |Type      |Description
|-----------   |----------|--------------
|resource      |string    | The name of the OSDI resource involved in the request; for example "osdi:person".
|response_code      |int       | The success or failure of the request for the resource, as indicated in the  [Response Codes for Atomic Requests](#response-codes-for-atomic-requests) table.
|error_descriptions |[ErrorDescription[]](#error-description) | A description of the error(s) which caused the request for the resource to fail.

#### Error Description

| Name          | Type      | Description
|-----------    |-----------|--------------
| error_code			| string	| A machine-readable reason for the error: for example, ````START_DATE_AFTER_END_DATE````
| description	| string	| A human-readable reason for the error: for example, "The start date occurs after the end date."
| properties | string[] | An array of strings referencing the property or properties in the resource which cause the error; for example, ````['start_date', 'end_date']````.
| hint | string | An indication of how to resolve this error.  For example, if the property is an email address which is deemed invalid according to a regular expression, the regular expression can be provided here; e.g. ````.+@.+(\..+)+````
| reference_code | string | A string which refers to an internal error report which may be used to diagnose the problem; for example, "Logger-2015-03-10-cecc4e52-b350-4dac-87fc-39fc819f8c48"

_[Back to top...](#)_

### Batch Requests
When a Batch Request response includes ````osdi:error```` status information, the response code in the parent request should reflect the status of the batch operation itself, such as the import operation.

For example, if the import operation succeeds, even if not every record was successfully imported, the response code should be 200.  Conversely, if there is a format error, or fault with the parent request itself, such as a JSON parse error, the response should be 400.

The sub-request error status is contained within an array with attribute name ````batch_errors````.  The sub-request array may omit status on successful sub-requests and only contain errors.

# Scenarios

{% include scenarios_intro.md %}

## Atomic Request

The consumer sends a request, which is expected to succeed or fail atomically.

This request fails for two reasons. First, the implementing system does not allow multiple-choice responses for questions of type "Paragraph".  Second, because the implementing system uses a regular expression for validating the ````name```` property of question responses, but one of the question responses does not match that regular expression.  Both errors are reported.

## Non-Atomic Request

In this scenario, a consumer attempts to use the [Person Signup Helper](person_signup.html) to create a Person, add a Tagging to that person, and add the person to the List.  The Person object is valid, but the Tagging is invalid because the Tags in question do not exist.  Moreover the implementing system does not support the ````osdi:item```` resource, and therefore adding the person to the list fails, as well.  The Person is created but is not Tagged or added to a List.  The success of the Person creation, failure of the Tagging creation, and failure to add to a List are all reported.

Because the request as a whole is invalid, an Error with response code 400 is returned.

The server has also provided detail about the created Person via an ````osdi:person```` response.

## Batch Request

A batch of people is uploaded via the ````osdi:people_import_helper````.  The overall upload succeeds, but there are two errors that are reported.
The first is an invalid tag in the ````add_tags```` helper action function, but the import of the person itself succeeds.
The second person fails to be imported because of a wonderful but invalid phone number.
